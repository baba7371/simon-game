## 🧠 How to Play

1. Click **"Start Game"**.
2. A modal explains the rules — close it to begin.
3. Watch the sequence of color flashes.
4. Repeat the exact color pattern by clicking buttons or using keyboard:
   - **W / Arrow Up** → Green  
   - **A / Arrow Left** → Red  
   - **S / Arrow Down** → Yellow  
   - **D / Arrow Right** → Purple
5. The game adds a new color to the sequence each round.
6. You have **5 seconds** to respond in each level.
7. Game ends on wrong input or timeout.
